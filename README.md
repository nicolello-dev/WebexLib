# Installation

### From source

1. Download the source code through git via `git clone https://github.com/nicolello-dev/WebexLib.git` or download as zip (and unzip) through the `Download as zip` button under `code` atop the page.
2. Open chrome, navigate to `chrome:extensions` and click on the `Load unpacked` button on the top-left. Navigate to the downloaded folder and select it

# Upgrading

If downloaded from the chrome store, nothing needs to be done, the script will update by itself. If ran through source, navigate to the downloaded folder and run `git pull`
